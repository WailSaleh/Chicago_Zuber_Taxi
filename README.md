# Chicago Zuber Taxi 🚕🗺️

I am working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company being launched in Chicago. The task is to find patterns in the available information. Want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

Working with a database, will analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

After getting and combining data with SQL will use Python to study more these data and do the analysis

**/datasets/project_sql_result_01.csv** 

*trips_amount: The number of rides for each taxi company from November 15 to November 16, 2017.*

**/datasets/project_sql_result_04.csv**

*dropoff_location_name: Chicago neighborhoods where the races ended*

*average_trips: The average number of trips that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017.*

**/datasets/project_sql_result_07.csv — the result of the last query**

*start_ts: Date and time of collection*

*weather_conditions: Weather conditions at the time the race started*

*duration_seconds: Duration of the run in seconds*

**Test the hypothesis:**

*"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."*
